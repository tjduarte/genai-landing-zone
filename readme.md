# ðŸš€ Building Enterprise Landing Zones for AI Apps

![Sample Architecture](images/sample_architecture.png)

This repository contains all the artifacts that have been used to build the infrastructure presented at Microsoft Build AI Day in Switzerland during my session.
With minimum setup, you can clone this repository and start working with your IT team to build an initial landing zone aimed at unlocking the usage of Azure OpenAI in your organization.

## Quick Start

### Step 1
Clone or download this repository to your machine.

### Step 2
Create a terraform variable file to be used as an input (*.tfvars). 
The example below illustrates how the file should be structured. 
You can also open [variables.tf](terraform/deployment/variables.tf) and check the required variables and formats.

```terraform
resource_suffix = "ch-msbuild-ai"

location = "westeurope"

resource_group = {
  name = "rg"
}

network_resource_group = {
  name = "rg-network"
}

open_ai = {
  name      = "oai"
  locations = ["swedencentral", "australiaeast"]
}

storage = {
  name           = "storage",
  container_name = "documents"
}

ai_search = {
  name        = "search",
  api_version = "2023-10-01-Preview"
}

apim = {
  name = "apim"
}

tags = {
  "description" = "AI Landing Zone"
}

virtual_network = {
  address_space = ["10.2.0.0/16"],
  name          = "vnet",
  subnets = {
    ai   = "10.2.0.0/24",
    apim = "10.2.1.0/24",
    vm   = "10.2.2.0/24"
  }
}

virtual_machine = {
  name = "vm"
}
```

### Step 3

Open a terminal window and login with an account with contributor permissions on the subscription you wish to use.

```bash
az login --tenant [Tenant_ID]
az account set -n [Subscription_ID]
```

### Step 4

Initialize your terraform workspace inside /terraform/deployment and plan the deployment.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out plan -var-file variables.tfvars
```

Once you are happy with the changes apply the plan

```bash
terraform apply plan
```

### Step 5

After the deployment has been successfully done, initialize your terraform workspace inside /terraform/post-configuration and plan the deployment.
This module creates the Index, Data source, Skillset and Indexer required to process documents uploaded to the storage account.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan -out plan -var-file variables.tfvars
```

Once you are happy with the changes apply the plan

```bash
terraform apply plan
```
